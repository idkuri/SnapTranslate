SnapTranslate

Stack: Electron.js (Frontend + Backend), Python (Screenshot tool), Google Cloud Translate/Vision.

SnapTranslate is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) translation tool that allows you to capture a snapshot of a portion of your screen and translate the extracted text into your desired language.
This tool is similar to the windows snipping tool in terms of capturing images and then extracts the text using Google Cloud Vision and then translates it using Google Cloud Translate API
